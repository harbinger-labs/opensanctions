  Current Members of the Canadian upper chamber, the Senate
description: |
  The Senate of Canada is the upper chamber of Canada's bicameral Parliament,
  alongside the House of Commons. The Senate consists of 105 members appointed
  by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister. Senators represent
  regions, provinces, and territories across Canada and serve until the age of 75.

  Senators come from diverse backgrounds including business, science, law,
  education, athletics, community leadership, and public service. They represent
  diverse ethnic, socio-economic, and cultural backgrounds.

  The Senate reviews legislation passed by the House of Commons, conducts independent
  inquiries and studies, and ensures that minorities have a strong voice in
  Parliament. Senators are independent and free to speak their minds and act
  on their consciences.
